Oh yeah - that hurts. Sunburn was as bad as I expected. This was the last day of the tour, and after breakfast I set about the serious business of lying in my hammock reading my book, stopping only briefly at 11 to bid farewell to Lorna and Charlotte, who left today for the mainland, and ultimately for Lorna, Edinburgh via Bangkok and London. Later on in the afternoon I realised that I probably didn’t have enough money to pay for the extra night plus all my drinks charges, so I considered returning to the mainland for some cash. It would have taken ages though, and eventually I managed to borrow a thousand baht from Steve. I couldn’t bring myslf to ask, but fortunately he offered.
