Today started rather well. On friday I went to an interview at the National Air Traffic Service for an information systems job, and this morning the personnel lady called to tell me I’d got it. Obviously my new suit had the desired effect. That means I can leve knowing I have a job lined up when I return. After receiving this news I went to buy some presents for Basil, his wife, and his personal assistant Pam. I’ve got a pocket-watch style desk clock for Basil, and some fragranced soaps for the women. Hope they like them.

Mum’s just got off the phone to Basil, and decided that she isn’t quite as worried about me as she was before, which is lucky.

Packing is almost finished, which is to say I’ve packed everything that I don’t need today or tomorrow morning, and well in advance too. Now I just have to waste 30 hours. And the internet connection’s just gone down again. I won’t be suprised if Basil has a more reliable internet connection than me.
