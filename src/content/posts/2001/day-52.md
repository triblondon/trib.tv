I am awakened early by a burning sensation in my legs. I whip off the sheets to find I am throughly sunburnt from mid-thigh to toe on both legs. A few minutes later I am still lying in the same position trying to decide whether to risk moving. Touching the reddened area I confirm quickly that yes, it does hurt. A lot. I spend the rest of the day taking it easy and swimming in the pool, to the amazement of onlookers. “Isn’t it cold?” asks a middle-aged woman, looking up from her book. But I’m not feeling the cold - the cold water provides some much needed relief for my sunburn.

I have dinner at Elina’s, and prepare for my last night at the Kingdom.
