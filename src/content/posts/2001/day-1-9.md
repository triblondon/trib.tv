I certainly haven’t got any better at this sleeping on planes lark. Can’t understand how anybody can sleep when you can’t possibly lie down flat and the noise of the engines reverberates around your head. I’m looking around the cabin, and almost everyone is asleep. The powers that be won’t let me use my laptop, I’m dying for a drink and I’ve begun to read my book without taking in the words on the page. I have entered the zombie state.

I have no idea where we are, and I’m not wearing a watch so I’ve no idea what the time is. At a guess I’d say we’re about half way there. The flight sems to be going on much longer than even the outbound to Australia last year - probably because I was alone.
