### Conference bios
    
If you've invited me to present at your event, here are some bios you can use.

#### Short

> Head of Developer relations at Fastly, former member of W3C Technical Architecture Group and co-chair of London Web Performance
        
#### Medium

> Andrew heads up developer relations for Fastly, working with developers across the world to help make the web faster, more secure, more reliable and easier to work with. He founded a web consultancy which was ultimately acquired by the Financial Times, led the team that created their pioneering HTML5 web app, and founded the FT's Labs division.  He has also been an elected member of the W3C Technical Architecture Group, a committee of nine people who guide the development of the World Wide Web.
        
#### Long

> Andrew heads up developer relations for Fastly, working with developers across the world to help make the web faster, more secure, more reliable and easier to work with. He founded a web consultancy startup which spent a decade working on innovative web projects for media clients including the Financial Times, News International and the Economist group, before being acquired by the FT in 2012.
> At the FT he led the team that created their pioneering HTML5 web app, and founded the FT's Labs and UI component divisions.  More recently he was elected a member of the W3C Technical Architecture Group, a committee of nine people who guide the development of the World Wide Web.
>Early in his career, Andrew also worked at British national air traffic control service during 9/11, founded, grew and successfully sold a web mapping startup, and planned and developed a web-based national logistics information network in Zimbabwe.  His current interests include many areas of the emerging web, and he will get cross at anyone who dares to suggest the 'mobile web' is a thing, which means he gets cross a lot.
