Artur has borrowed the car to take Rita to the hospital, and the weather is still overcast, so we have a late start (again) and potter about reading and trying to make the pool table work, unsuccessfully, until lunchtime. Some fishermen arrive with some fresh prawns, so we buy a kilo (at prices comparable with a supermarket at home, which seems a mite pricy to me) and make a prawn curry for lunch.

Artur doesn’t get back until abut 2:30pm, so we abandon plans for Tofo and go for a walk along the beach instead, setting off in the other direction, towards the lighthouse. Round the headland the beach becomes rockier, but after clambouring ovr a few outcrops, we end up on a section of unbroken beach that stretches into the far distance, probably all the way to Tofo, which we’re told is a two hour walk.

Not really wanting to walk back along the beach in the dark, particularly as it involves climbing over rocks, we turn back and spend the late afternoon and evening reading on the deck.
