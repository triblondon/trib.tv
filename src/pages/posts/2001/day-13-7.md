Simon runs a small shop for the community surrounding Basil’s Harare office. Today Simon, David and I go to the local supermarket (significantly less local than you might expect), to get some stock for it, and fill up three big trolleys with consumables. The prices are generally about three or four times lower than the UK, but in some cases the difference is staggering. Cigarettes are over **fifty times** cheaper - no doubt due to far lower taxes, and natively grown tobacco. Good job I don’t smoke.

We drive on to the shop itself to deliver the stock, and then retuen home around 5. Wonder if there are any good movies on tonight. I’ve had enough of horrors for now though.
