Apart from more Playstation and TV, highlights of the day include going shopping for some new clothes, which are about three or four times cheaper than in the UK, and CDs, which are not. In the evening I go to the local cinema with Simon and Rosemary (his cousin, Mike’s daughter - keep up, willya?) to see The Exorcist. Although I’m a fairly anti-horror person, as many of my friends will attest, I was quite curious to see this famous film.

It was pretty much as expected, and not really very terrifying - nowhere near as scary as Blair Witch anyway. The cinema was not as expected though. It was by far the largest capacity cinema I have ever seen, and I count myself fairly well travelled cinema-wise.
