Leaving at 7am again, Basil and I go to his office, via the Lyons office (tea company), to strike a deal. At the office I download my email and find that although the internet connection is not good, I can get on ICQ, which is actually more than I can do at home. I spend the rest of the day at the office, observing proceedures and chatting to Pam and Joyce. At the end of the day Basil gives me a guided tour of the complex, and then we drive home. Dinner is take away pizza while watching “The House on Haunted Hill”.

The pictures are of Basil’s Personal Assistant, Pam, and the plant manager, Benny.
