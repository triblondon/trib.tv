No word from the service provider about my enquiry for a permanent connection, so I phone them to see if there are any human beings to talk to. There are. They inform me that a radio connection will be required and that the setup cost will be about Z$400,000 with a monthly fee of around Z$6000 a month. Unfortunately a new repeater station may be required in which case the cost may rise to Z$1million, which sounds horrendous, but is actually about £5000. I call two other service providers (there only seem to be three), and am still waiting for them to call back. Whatever the chosen option it’s still going to take around two weeks to install it, so it doesn’t give me much time.
