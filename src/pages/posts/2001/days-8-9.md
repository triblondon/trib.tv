Both Tuesday and Wednesday are fairly uneventful - I spend both days at the Reapers office in Harare talking to various people and creating my plan for the new stock control system. I also contact MWeb to find out about upgrading the internet service to a permenant connection. On Wednesday evening Basil and I have dinner with Basil’s cousin, Mike, at an enormous colonial-style house that probably would have cost several million in the UK but was only about £100,000 for Mike to purchase three months ago.
