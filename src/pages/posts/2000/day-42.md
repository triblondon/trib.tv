I can now officially say that I’ve slept in an airport. And as airports go, Singapore isn’t a bad choice. The annoying thing was that the really nice comfy chairs (the ones in that lounge I mentioned ages ago) were in the transit area, which you can’t get to without checking in. And you can’t check in until two hours prior to departure. So we went to the food court and had some snacks, and watched BBC world on the TVs overhead. They also had a pool table so we played a few games on that too. This left us with about four hours to kill until the earliest we could possibly be allowed to check in. I found a kid’s play area, one of the ones with soft rubber on the floor, and slept there - David chose to ‘roam the airport’.

At about 6am, I had breakfast, then we collected our luggage and tried to check in again - at least there were QANTAS people in attendance now. Mercifully they allowed us through, and I made sure I got our exit-row seats. After the formalities of emigration and customs, we entered the transit area, where the seats are comfy sofas instead of moulded plastic and metal, and where there is an internet area and a cactus garden. We were almost rushed.
